        A
       / \
      B   C
Where A is the parent of B and C. In this case, If there is some Data only in component B but, component C also wants that data. We know Component C cannot access the data because a component can talk only to its parent or child (Not cousins).

Problem: Letâ€™s Implement this with a simple but general example. We are considering the second example.

Approach: To solve this, we will Lift the state of component B and component C to component A. Make A.js as our Main Parent by changing the path of App in the index.js file
